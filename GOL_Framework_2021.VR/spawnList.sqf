	=======================================

	OKS_fnc_Destroy_Task

	Setup a destroy/kill objective on a target.

	Code:

	Params:
	Target Object, Task Title, Target Type, Task Description, Task Icon, Task Parent, Should Mark Position on Map, Should Show Popup when created/completed

	=======================================

	OKS_fnc_Evacuate_HVT

	Setup a HVT Capture Objective. The last variable sets true/false if they target should be set to captive (tied hands). False for enemy officers, true for friendly captives.

	Code:
	[Group HVT_1,getMarkerPos "respawn_west",west,false,nil,true] spawn OKS_fnc_Evacuate_HVT;

	Params:
	Group of HVT, Exfil Position (Either pickup (Extract On) or dropoff (Extract off)), Side of Extract Helicopter, Should Send AI Helicopter Evac, Parent Task, Is Captive

	=======================================

	OKS_fnc_Destroy_Barricade

	Setup Barricade Objective. Objective to destroy objects lined up as a blockade on a road. Make sure the object is destructible by testing it.

	Code:
	[[barricade_1,barricade_2],nil,false] spawn OKS_fnc_Destroy_Barricade;

	Params:
	Array with Barricade Objects, Taks Parent, Should Add Action (To single barriacade that can't be destroyed)

	=======================================

	OKS_fnc_Convoy_Spawn

	Spawn a convoy that moves until engaged, they will dismount, armed vehicles will hunt and dismounts will rush.

	Code:
	[spawn_1,waypoint_1,end_1,west,[4,["rhs_btr60_msv"], 6, 25],[true,6],[], false, false] spawn OKS_fnc_Convoy_Spawn;

	Params:
	Spawn Position, First Waypoint, End Waypoint (Scattered formation), Side of Convoy, Convoy Array [](Number, [TypeArray]), Speed meters/second, dispersion]
	Dismount Array (Should have dismount, how many), ConvoyArray to populate variable, forced careless (ignore everything), delete on arrival.

	=======================================

	OKS_fnc_Lambs_SpawnGroup

	Spawns a team that either creep/rush/hunt based on LAMBS. Used for quick and intense counter-attacks by enemy infantry.

	Code:
	[SpawnPos,"rush",UnitsPerBase,Side,Range,[]] spawn OKS_fnc_Lambs_SpawnGroup;

	Params:
	Position, Type of Waypoint (rush,creep,hunt), Units to spawn, Side of units, Range of waypoint (around the spawn), unit array that gets populated with the units.


	=======================================

	OKS_fnc_Defuse_Explosive

	Creates a defuse explosive objective with 600 (10 minutes) seconds to complete on the "SatchelCharge" object with the name bomb_1.
	This can be replaced with a position to create an explosive on the position using getPos bomb_1.

	Code:
	[bomb_1,600] spawn OKS_fnc_Defuse_Explosive;
	[bomb_1,60,bombtarget_1,"parentTask",true,false,"VariableOnSuccess","VariableOnFail"] spawn OKS_fnc_Defuse_Explosive;

		   Dynamic Script Params
		   0 - Trigger Name (Object)
		   1 - Disabled - Keep False
		   2 - Number of Infantry - [Static Integer,Patrol Integer,CreateSectorObjective?,LocalPatrols?] (Array) -
		   3 - Wheeled Patrols (Integer/Number)
		   4 - APC Patrols (Integer/Number)
		   5 - Tank Patrols (Integer/Number)
		   6 - Roadblocks [RoadBlocksCount,OnlyOnTarmac,LocalPatrols?,NumberChanceForVehicle(0-1)] (Array)
		   7 - Mortar Pits [MortarCount,LocalPatrols?] (Array)
		   8 - Random Objectives [ObjectiveCount,LocalPatrols?] (Array)
		   9 - Hunt Array Bases [Infantry,Wheeled,APC,Tank,Helicopter]
		   10 - Dynamic Civilians on? (Boolean)

			Local Patrols - This means that the strongpoints / roadblocks / mortar pits / objectives have their own local patrols near their position.
			If you use it on Parameter 2, 30% of the static contacts will be turned into patrols.

		   Note:
		   The Dynamic Scripts does work on its own however is very limited in selecting positions for strongpoints.
		   You as an editor can assist the dynamic script by placing down locations for pinpointing different positions.
		   In Eden-Editor "Location"s can be found in Systems (F5) and Game Logics > Locations.

		   Area, Base, City, Evac Point, Resupply Point & Town -> Spawns Strongpoints & Sector Tasks (Selects Random Buildings in Area. Generally more contacts per building)
		   Outpost -> Spawns Compounds & Sector Tasks (Selects all buildings in range of compoundSize (Settings) and spawns even-spread over all buildings)
		   FOB -> Spawns Roadblocks, use the direction of the logic to define the direction of the roadblock.
		   Respawn Point -> If you use HuntBases these locations will be picked, use the direction of the logic to choose the spawn direction 15-25m away from logic.
		   Camp -> Static Objective positions, once again direction of logic defines direction of Objective compositions.
		   Village -> Defines village area for the Dynamic Civilian presence, radius is found in Settings.sqf

		   All Locations are not required, the script will find its own locations, however for the best experience and best result, help the dynamic script by placing these logics.

		   Example:
		   [Trigger_1,false,[0,0,false,false],east,0,0,0,[0,true,false,0],[0,false],[0,false],[0,0,0,0,0],false] spawn OKS_fnc_CreateZone;
